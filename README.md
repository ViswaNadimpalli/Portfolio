# Portfolio Introduction
Hello, my name is Viswa Nadimpalli and this is a portfolio of all the projects I have done so far throughout High School. I have a decent amount of experience with Java, Python, and SwiftUI/SpriteKit, and also minor experience with C and C++.

# [Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)
Volcanic Panic was a survival game that I made with a few peers in AP Computer Science A. The objective of the game is to avoid obstacles and survive for the longest time possible and try to beat your locally recorded high score. This was my first experience with creating a small game and I learned that assets are also a crucial part of the game on top of coding. I understood that many components went into making a game and it is actually a very complex process to create even a simple game.

# [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal)
Astro Portal is a level based platformer that I made along with 2 peers in iOS App Development in 11th grade. It is available on the App Store and made primarily using SpriteKit. We made the artwork for the game using Sketch and Google Drawings and spent a lot of time creating maps for each level and the different obstacles in the game. This was my first actual experience with creating a public game, and I was very happy with how it turned out.

# [EPHS Maps](https://github.com/sarthyparty/Find-My-EP)
EPHS Maps is a project that I am currently working on with 3 peers. It is meant to be an app that new students or parents can use to navigate through EPHS by entering the starting room and desired destination. It is available on the App Store and it was made using SwiftUI and a little bit of UIKit. I chose to make this app because I had previous experience with making a game and wanted to see how making a regular app with different components compares to making a game. The biggest difficulties we have faced as a team so far is figuring out the Zoom interaction with the map UI and creating an algorithm that calculates the shorest possible distance given 2 rooms. So far, we have features such as showing the distance from the starting position to the destination, the approximate time it takes to get to your destination, switching between floors using buttons, fitting the zoom to show the path, etc. We plan on adding a nearest bathroom and nearest exit feature in the future.
